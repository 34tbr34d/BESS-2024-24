# **First Spatial Analysis**
**Objective:** Identify areas where voles are likely to thrive due to proximity to water bodies and vegetation types in Segovia, Spain.

### Hydrology
  #### Hidrografía de Castilla y León: masas de agua (download SHP) - https://datos.gob.es/es/catalogo/a07002862-hidrografia-de-castilla-y-leon-masas-de-agua
##### - This hydrology layer is polygonal data (vector) on water bodies within Castilla y Leon (rivers, lakes, reservoirs and ponds)
##### - Scale Resolution of 1:25,000
##### - Data published by the Junta de Castilla y Leon, specifically the autonomous administration working under environmental managemnet
##### - Licsensed under the IGCYL-NC license
##### - Dataset created and last updated in 2012
#### **Relevance**: This hydrology layer can be used when identifying areas where voles will thrive because water availability plays a role in shaping the vegetation distribution, and voles rely on this (and especially greener plants found closer to water bodies) for food and cover. Areas near water sources tend to support dense vegetation, in turn creating ideal habitats for voles.

# **Second Spatial Analysis**
**Objective:** Identify areas in Segovia, Spain that have a high risk in terms of vole populations, focusing towards agricultural zones that are vulnerable to economic loss (due to crop damage), and regions with high erosion potential where soil degredation can amplify environmental and economic impacts.

##### - Scale Resolution of 1:30,000
##### - Data posted by the Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), under the National Soil Erosion Inventory (INES)
##### - The methodology used to generate the erosion potential was based on scientific research and historical data
##### - Dataset last updated in 2014
##### - Data is Raster file, values represent different erosion potential levels: 0-1 = null or very low, 2-3 = low or moderate, 4-5 = medium, 6-7 = high, 8-9-10 = very high
#### **Relevance**: This Erosion Potential layer
