# **First Spatial Analysis**
**Objective:** Identify areas where voles are likely to thrive due to proximity to water bodies and vegetation types in Segovia, Spain.

### Hydrology
#### Hidrografía de Castilla y León: masas de agua (download SHP) - https://datos.gob.es/es/catalogo/a07002862-hidrografia-de-castilla-y-leon-masas-de-agua => Resolution - 1:25,000
##### - This hydrology layer is polygonal data on water bodies within Castilla y Leon (rivers, lakes, reservoirs and ponds)
##### - Scale of 1:25,000
##### - Data published by the Junta de Castilla y Leon, specifically the autonomous administration working under environmental managemnet
##### - Licsensed under the IGCYL-NC license
##### - Dataset created and last updated in 2012
##### - **Relevance**: This hydrology layer can be used when identifying areas where voles will thrive because water availability plays a role in shaping the vegetation distribution, and voles rely on this (and especially greener plants found closer to water bodies) for food and cover. Areas near water sources tend to support dense vegetation, in turn creating ideal habitats for voles.
